## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/icon-studio.git
```

If using Visual Studio Code, use the [Live Server Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to host the html file.
Opening the html file in your browser does not work, as loading the css and js files need to be done via a webserver because of CORS.

No build process required - Icon Studio runs entirely in the browser!
